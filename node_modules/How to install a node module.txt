To Install a node module in the extension

1)  open the node_modules folder in terminal
    i.e. from sublime text right click this file and select "Open terminal here..."
    or ⌘⇧t (Command Shift t) this presumes that the open terminal plugin has been added

2)  type in npm install nodeModuleName
    i.e. npm install node-schedule

(-: Pretty Simple :-)
